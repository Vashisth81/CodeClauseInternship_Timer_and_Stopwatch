# ToDo App 

A to-do list is just a list of things you have to-do. That means basically anything and everything can be on your to-do list—but just because you’ve written your to-dos down doesn’t mean your to-do list is actually useful. Effectively tracking when your work is due can help you prioritize and get great work done


**Features:**
- Add tasks with a title and optional description.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Filter tasks based on completion status (All, Active, Completed).
- Clear all completed tasks in one click.
- Responsive design for seamless usage on various devices.
